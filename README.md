**CloudSix**

This is a total replacement of Tarkov's built in clouds.

**NOTE: If you are running SPT-VR you do not need this mod, it is built into SPT-VR.**

After over analyzing my clouds in VR, I went to test something on flatscreen and it kinda hit me how low res the clouds looked. So, I just added the clouds on flatscreen and it looks pretty good on there also. This is still a work in progress, not much configuration for now because of the sky changing frame by frame. Shouldn't be hard to add at some point though.

Since this is a work in progress still, keep in mind, there will probably be some mix of weather condition and time of day that doesn't look right. There's a lot of manual timing done and color adjustments so it's hard to account for everything.

**Features:**
- Weather affects density
- Wind affects cloud speed
- Physically aware of sun and moon placement
- Coloring based on sky/sun color/Time of day
- Shading based on sun direction
- "fake" subsurface scattering
- Rim lighting on clouds from sun/moon
- Well optimized - this is literally just a dome with a scrolling 2D texture on it with cool shader tricks to give it depth
